DJI F450
========

This section covers the build and configuration of my DJI F540. This unit
was the first quadcopter I owned. I received the DJI Flame Wheel F450
multi-rotor along with a Spektrum DX6i transmitter as a birthday gift.

The f450 came as an almost ready to fly package (un-assembled) as my wife
new that I would enjoy building it up from scratch and learning all about it.

When I was building this unit I didn't know anyone who had built up a drone
so I didn't have anyone to ask about their setup. From my internet searching
it looked like there are a few different ways to set up the same transmitter
and flight controller.
