Flight Log
==========

This section records some of my early flights where I was trying to work out
how to properly configure the MC and the transmitter as well as learn to fly
the drone.

This flight was just trying to get the thing off the ground so I could say
I had made some progress. I had no idea what mode it was in (I think it was
in manual). I had previously checked that the motors were

I managed to get it off the ground and up to about 3 metres high. I very
gradually manuvered it around and then brought it down thankful I hadn't
crashed it.

This flight was aimed at testing the GPS Attitude mode. By this time I had
finally configured the transmitter to be able to set the NAZA MC into GPS
Attitude mode. I plugged in the battery and got the ESC tune. I observed the
LED flashing green and red giving me an indication that it was in GPS mode.
After a little while the red flashed dissappeared indicatin a good GPS signal
by staying green.

I then tried to slowly increase the throttle in an attempt to take off but the
drone seemed very unstable and was making a wierd whistling noise that I did
not recall from the first flight. I tried a few times to increase the throttle
but the instability and noise remained.

Eventually the drone tilted too far and then flipped over. Nothing was broken
but I think I've got some investigating to do.
