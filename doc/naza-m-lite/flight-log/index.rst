Flight Log
==========

This section records some of my early flights where I was trying to work out
how to properly configure the MC and the transmitter as well as learn to fly
the drone.

This flight was just trying to get the thing off the ground so I could say
I had made some progress. I had no idea what mode it was in (I think it was
in manual). I had previously checked that the motors were

I managed to get it off the ground and up to about 3 metres high. I very
gradually manoeuvred it around and then brought it down thankful I hadn't
crashed it.

This flight was aimed at testing the GPS Attitude mode. By this time I had
finally configured the transmitter to be able to set the NAZA MC into GPS
Attitude mode. I plugged in the battery and got the ESC tune. I observed the
LED flashing green and red giving me an indication that it was in GPS mode.
After a little while the red flashed disappeared indication a good GPS signal
by staying green.

I then tried to slowly increase the throttle in an attempt to take off but the
drone seemed very unstable and was making a weird whistling noise that I did
not recall from the first flight. I tried a few times to increase the throttle
but the instability and noise remained.

Eventually the drone tilted too far and then flipped over. Nothing was broken
but I think I've got some investigating to do.

I tried to fly the drone again but the wobble remains. As I power up the
motors the struts begin to wobble and the strut holding motor 1 get quite
violent. I'm not sure if it is cavitating. It looks like there is some kind
of resonance that builds up and reinforces the wobble. Some internet searching
indicates that it might be related to the flexible DJI legs connected to the
bottom of the drone. I've taken these off and will try to fly it again.

Success, I got it flying. There was still a bit of a wobble on take off. It's
like the M1 strut takes off first which tilts the craft a bit. If I slowly
increase the throttle it seems like it will flip over. If I really commit
and push the stick up quickly it takes off and levels out. It's probably a
mixture of inexperience and me not wanting the smash that drone before I've
had a chance to fly it around. The longer legs definitely increase the wobble.

Now that I've got it flying I'll spend a bit of time doing lots of take off
and some simple manoeuvring to get used to it. Then I'll begin testing out
the capabilities of the MC and checking that the Failsafe works. Once that's
done I guess I'll start flying it a bit higher and a bit further away.
