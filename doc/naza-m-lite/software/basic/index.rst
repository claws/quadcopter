Basic
=====

This section of the documentation covers how I configured settings in the
Basic panel of the DJI NAZA-M LITE Assitant application.

Mounting
--------

In the hardware section I mentioned that I had set up the MC in the centre
of the bottom plate with the line on the MC pointing out the nose of the
multi-rotor.


RC
---

I set the Receiver Type to Traditional.

When the transmitter has been successfully bound to the receiver then moving
the control sticks will result in the sliders moving in the Command Sticks
Calibrartion area.

I chose to leave the REV/NORM settings set to NORM and made an reversing
changes on the transmitter.

.. note::

    If you modify and channel settings (especially the throttle) you should
    re-bind the receiver so that the failsafe throttle setting is properly
    set.


Gain
----

I did not mess around with the gain settings.
