Transmitter
===========

In this section I will describe how I configured the Spektrum DX6i to
control the NAZA-M LITE on my DJI F-450 multi-rotor drone.


Attitude Control
----------------

This section wil cover how I configured the Transmitter to control the
Control Mode Switch channel. The DX6i only how 2 position switches but
this really requires a 3 position switch to switch between Manual, Atti
and GPS attitude control modes.


Intelligent Orientation Control
-------------------------------

I have configured the course lock to be mapped to the ? toggle switch.
