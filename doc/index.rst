==========

This site holds my working notes as I build at least one quadcopter, configure
the transmitter and the main flight controller (MC) software. This will help
me remember how to do it all again if I need to and may even help someone else
embarking on a similar journey.

I received a DJI Flame Wheel F450 multi-rotor drone along with a Spektrum DX6i
transmitter as a birthday gift. The drone came un-assembled as my wife new
that I would enjoy building it up from scratch and learning all about it.

I don't personally know anyone who has built up a drone so I haven't got
anyone to ask about their setup. Also, from a brief search of the internet
it looks like there are a few different ways to set up the same transmitter
and flight controller into a working drone.

The MC I'm using is a DJI NAZA-M LITE. It's possible that in future I may get
another flight controller so I'll group all of the current information under
the NAZA-M LITE section.
